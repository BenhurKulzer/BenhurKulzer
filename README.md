### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Benhur KÃ¼lzer, a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, specializing in mobile and frontend development using React Native, Kotlin, Swift, and ReactJS. At BrandLovrs, I led the development of a mobile app that significantly increased user engagement, contributing to the securing of a $50 million investment. While working at Bear Robotics (through Jobsity), I created native applications for watchOS and wearOS, enabling real-time control of autonomous robots. I am passionate about transforming complex challenges into simple and intuitive experiences, using innovative technology to solve real-world problems.
